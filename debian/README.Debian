libnl2 for Debian
-----------------

This is a snapshot release of libnl. The last official release was 1.1
on 2008-01-14. Since then a lot of changes happened upstream.

As of 2010-02-15 no actual plan to release a stable libnl2 is known.
It may be possible that the upstream developer introduces additional
changes before releasing an official libnl2 which could result in
breakage in users of this snapshot.
